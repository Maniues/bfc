This page describes how to install and run bfc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need LLVM and Rust installed to compile bfc. For Rust, I
recommend [using rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

#### LLVM

bfc is built against recent LLVM. See [the changelog](changelog.md)
for information on the most recent LLVM version used.

You can usually install LLVM from your package manager of
choice. Alternatively, you can build LLVM from source as follows:

```
$ wget http://llvm.org/pre-releases/3.8.0/rc1/llvm-3.8.0rc1.src.tar.xz
$ tar -xf llvm-3.8.0rc1.src.tar.xz

$ mkdir -p ~/tmp/llvm_3_8_build
$ cd ~/tmp/llvm_3_8_build

$ cmake -G Ninja /path/to/untarred/llvm
$ ninja
```

bfc uses [llvm-sys](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys), which wraps
the locally installed LLVM.

**llvm-sys requires the `llvm-config` binary to be installed**. Check
that your LLVM installation includes this (not all packages do,
especially on Windows).

llvm-sys will use whatever `llvm-config` is first on `PATH`. For
example, to use the prebuilt LLVM shown above:

```
$ export PATH=~/tmp/llvm_3_8_build:$PATH
```

### Compiling bfc

bfc should be compiled with cargo, Rust's packaging and build
tool. Cargo will download necessary dependencies (other than LLVM), so
an internet connection is required.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Wilfred/bfc.git
$ cd bfc
$ cargo build --release
```

## Running bfc

You can now compile and run BF programs as follows:

```
$ target/release/bfc sample_programs/hello_world.bf
$ ./hello_world
Hello World!
```

You can use debug builds of bfc, but bfc will run much slower on large
BF programs. This is due to bfc's speculative execution. You can
disable this by passing `--opt=0` or `--opt=1` when running bfc.

```
$ target/debug/bfc --opt=0 sample_programs/hello_world.bf
```

### Cross-compilation

By default, bfc compiles programs to executables that run on the
current machine. You can explicitly specify architecture using LLVM
target triples:

```
$ target/release/bfc sample_programs/hello_world.bf --target=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
```

## Diagnostics

bfc can report syntax errors and warnings with relevant line numbers
and highlighting.

Note that some warnings are generated during analysis for optimisation, so disabling
optimisations will produce fewer warnings.
